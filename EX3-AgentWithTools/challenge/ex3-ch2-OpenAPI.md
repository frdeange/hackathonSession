## 📋 **Technical Requirements**

### 🥇 **Basic Level (20-25 minutes)** ✅ MAIN GOAL

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #28a745; margin: 10px 0;">

**Perfect for getting started with real API integration!**

- [ ] ✅ Successfully connect to the real inventory API
- [ ] ✅ Ask for a complete inventory list and display results
- [ ] ✅ Search for items by category (Mechanical, Electrical, Hydraulic, etc.)
- [ ] ✅ Find items with low stock levels
- [ ] ✅ Ask specific questions about individual inventory items

</div>

### 🌟 **Advanced Level (Extra 10 minutes for fast finishers)** ⭐ BONUS

<div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; margin: 10px 0;">

**For those who finish early and want extra credit!**

- [ ] 🔥 Create an interactive session where users can ask multiple inventory questions
- [ ] 🔥 Generate a maintenance planning report based on current stock levels
- [ ] 🔥 Identify which items need immediate reordering

</div>

## 💡 **Getting Started Hints**

### 🟢 **Basic Level Implementation**

<details>
<summary>🔍 <strong>Click to see starter questions</strong></summary>

```python
# Simple questions to test with the real API
inventory_questions = [
    "Show me all the inventory items we currently have",
    "What mechanical components do we have in stock?", 
    "Which items have low stock levels that need reordering?",
    "Tell me about the Temperature Sensor E34 Series",
    "How many hydraulic components are in our inventory?",
    "What's the current status of all electrical items?"
]

# The real API returns items like:
# - Temperature Sensor E34 Series (Sensors)
# - Motor Bearing for Machine 12 (Mechanical) 
# - Control Relay CR400 (Electrical)
# - Hydraulic Seal HS50 (Hydraulic)
# - Conveyor Belt CB200 - 2m (Mechanical)
```

</details>

### 📡 **Real API Information**

<div style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; margin: 10px 0;">

**🌐 API Endpoint**: Example endpoint for inventory management

**📋 Available Data**:
- ✅ **Item Names**: Industrial components like sensors, bearings, relays
- ✅ **Categories**: Sensors, Mechanical, Electrical, Hydraulic  
- ✅ **Stock Levels**: Current quantities and minimum stock thresholds
- ✅ **Locations**: Warehouse sections and storage areas

**🔧 What Works**:
- ✅ Get all inventory items (`/inventory` endpoint)
- ✅ View detailed item information
- ⚠️ Some advanced endpoints may return 404 (this is normal!)

</div>

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Guide**

### Step 1: Set Up the Connection (5 minutes)

1. Copy `ex3-s3-AgentWithOpenAPI-aad.py` to `challenge3_solution.py`
2. Verify the OpenAPI specification path points to `openApiDef/InventoryAPI.json`
3. Test that the basic connection works by running the example

### Step 2: Explore the Real Data (10 minutes)

1. Start with: *"Show me all inventory items"*
2. Look at the actual data returned - you'll see real industrial components!
3. Note the categories and item types available
4. Identify which items have low stock

### Step 3: Ask Targeted Questions (10 minutes)

1. Ask about specific categories: *"What mechanical items do we have?"*
2. Search for specific items: *"Tell me about the temperature sensor"*
3. Check stock levels: *"Which items are low on stock?"*
4. Generate insights: *"Summarize our inventory by category"*

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

Your solution is complete when:

<div style="background: #e7f3ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; margin: 10px 0;">

✅ **Successfully connects** to the real inventory API  
✅ **Retrieves and displays** actual inventory data  
✅ **Answers questions** about specific categories and items  
✅ **Identifies low stock items** that need attention  
✅ **Provides clear, actionable insights** about inventory status

</div>

## 🔍 **Example Questions to Try**

Based on the real data in the API, try these specific questions:

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0;">

### 🔧 **Category-Based Searches:**
- *"Show me all mechanical components in our inventory"*
- *"What electrical items do we currently have?"*
- *"List all hydraulic components and their stock levels"*

### 📊 **Stock Management:**
- *"Which items are at or below their minimum stock levels?"*
- *"What's our current inventory value by category?"*
- *"Show me items that need immediate reordering"*

### 🔍 **Specific Item Queries:**
- *"Tell me about the Control Relay CR400"*
- *"What's the status of our conveyor belt inventory?"*
- *"Where is the Motor Bearing for Machine 12 located?"*

### 📈 **Business Insights:**
- *"Generate a summary report of our inventory status"*
- *"What maintenance items should we prioritize for restocking?"*
- *"Which warehouse locations have the most items?"*

## 🆘 **Need Help?**

<details>
<summary>🚨 <strong>Common Issues & Solutions</strong></summary>

**❌ Connection fails to API**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the OpenAPI specification path is correct: `openApiDef/InventoryAPI.json`
- Ensure your Azure credentials are properly configured

**❌ Agent says "no items found"**  
- The API definitely has data! Try simpler questions first
- Start with: *"Show me all inventory items"*
- Make sure you're asking about categories that exist: Mechanical, Electrical, Hydraulic, Sensors

**❌ Some endpoints return 404 errors**
- This is normal! Not all OpenAPI endpoints are implemented
- Focus on the main `/inventory` endpoint which definitely works
- The agent should handle 404s gracefully and still provide useful information

**❌ Responses are unclear**
- Ask more specific questions about the data you see
- Request summaries: *"Summarize this inventory data"*
- Ask for explanations: *"What does this inventory status mean?"*
