# 1. Authentication / Client setup (OpenAI SDK with Azure OpenAI endpoint)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# To interact with Azure OpenAI using the standard OpenAI SDK, you need a client object.
# This approach allows you to use the familiar OpenAI SDK syntax while connecting
# to your Azure OpenAI deployment.
#
# This client is responsible for:
#   - Connecting to your Azure OpenAI endpoint
#   - Handling authentication (API key)
#   - Making requests to Azure OpenAI using OpenAI SDK format
#
# CORE parameters for Azure OpenAI with OpenAI SDK:
# - base_url (required): Your Azure OpenAI endpoint + path with API version
# - api_key (required): Your Azure OpenAI API key for authentication
#
# ADVANCED NETWORK / HTTP OPTIONS (optional):
# - timeout: Global timeout for requests (float or httpx.Timeout).
# - max_retries: How many times to retry transient errors (default is usually fine).
# - default_headers: Extra headers applied to every request.
# - http_client: A custom httpx.Client if you need proxy, connection pooling, etc.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
client = OpenAI(
    base_url=f"{azure_openai_endpoint}openai/deployments/{azure_openai_deployment}",
    api_key=azure_openai_key,    
    default_query={"api-version": azure_openai_api_version}
)

# 2. Creating a Chat Completion Request using the client
# When you send a request to Azure OpenAI using the OpenAI SDK, you need to provide some information 
# so the service knows which model to use and how to answer. The key parts are:
#
# Required parameters:
# - model: When using Azure OpenAI with OpenAI SDK, this should be the deployment name (not the base model name).
# - Messages: The conversation you send, broken down by roles: 
#   * system: overall instructions (e.g., "You are an educational assistant").
#   * user: what the person writes or asks.
#   * assistant: what the AI responds.
#
# Additional optional parameters:
## - stream: Boolean, default false. whether to send back the response in chunks (useful for real-time applications). 
## - max_completion_tokens: The maximum length of the answer, measured in "tokens" (small chunks of text).
## - Temperature: Controls how creative vs. predictable the answer is.
#   * Low = safer, more repetitive answers.
#   * High = more creative, varied answers.
## - top_p: Another way to control diversity. Instead of randomness, it tells the model 
#   to only pick from the most likely options.
## - frequency_penalty: Reduces how much the AI repeats the same words.
## - presence_penalty: Encourages the AI to bring in new ideas instead of sticking 
#   to what's already said.

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",  # Use standard model name when using OpenAI SDK with Azure
    max_completion_tokens=1500,
    temperature=1.0,
    top_p=1.0,
    frequency_penalty=0.0,
    presence_penalty=0.0,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "I'm visiting Barcelona for a tech event. In my free time, what should I see?",
        }
    ]
)

# 3. Print the response with clear formatting and explanations
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# At this stage we want to display two things:
#   A) The content of the AI's reply (what the assistant actually said).
#   B) A breakdown of how many tokens were used.
#      - Prompt tokens: what we sent in (system + user messages).
#      - Completion tokens: what the model generated in its response.
#      - Total tokens: sum of both, useful for cost calculation.
# This helps users not only see the output, but also understand the cost/usage impact.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# A) Print the actual assistant reply
print("\n" + "="*50)
print("🤖 Assistant Response")
print("="*50)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
print("="*50 + "\n")

# B) Print token usage details in a clean format
print("📊 Token Usage Details")
print("-"*50)
print(f"Prompt tokens (input sent):      {response.usage.prompt_tokens}")
print(f"Completion tokens (AI response): {response.usage.completion_tokens}")
print(f"Total tokens (input + output):   {response.usage.total_tokens}")
print("-"*50 + "\n")
